Game Rules 

Game rule is mainly based on https://www.unorules.com/, however, refer to the rules below for slight modification for the game program. 

In this UNO game, there is at least 2 players and a maximum of 4 players. 

The game starts from the first player in a clockwise direction. 

The game ends when there is a winner if the player has the highest scores when there is empty draw pile or if the player has zero on hands cards. 

A player loses immediately when the number of on hands cards reach more than 10 which means the player will drop out of the games as soon it reaches 11 cards. 

For the decks in each gameplay, there should be a total of 40 cards including 20 number cards, 4 ‘Wild Draw Four’ cards, 4 ‘Wild’ cards, 4 ‘Draw Two’ cards, 4 ‘Skip’ cards and 4 ‘Reverse cards. 

The scores of each player are based on: 

-Face values (0-9 points each)	 for Number cards 

-20 Points each 			for ‘Draw Two’, ‘Skip’, ‘Reverse’ cards 

-50 Points each 			for ‘Wild’, ‘Wild Draw Four’ cards 

Each player initially starts with 5 cards. 

During playing a card, each player must match either by the number, colour, or the action on the cards. For example, if the discard pile has a blue card that is a 5, the player must place either a blue card or a card with a 5 on it.  

Other than playing number cards, the player can also choose other ‘Draw Two’, ‘Reverse’ or ‘Skip’ cards of same colour. Otherwise, the player can pick ‘Wild’ or ‘Wild Draw Four’ card and mention the desired colour, then the colour in the discard pile will change to the new colour. 

If the ‘Reverse’ card is played, the direction should be changed to anticlockwise from clockwise and vice versa. 

If the ‘Skip’ card is played, the next player cannot have his/her turn. The player after the next player will play his/her card. 

If the ‘Draw Two’ or ‘Wild Draw Four’ card is used, the next player must draw the specific number of cards immediately. For example, the player needs to draw 2 cards when previous player use ‘Draw Two’ card and draw 4 cards when previous players use ‘Wild Draw Four’ card. The effect cannot be stacked with another ‘Draw Two’ or ‘Wild Draw Four’ card. 

After the action cards, the player in the next turn must play card according to the colour or number of last number card played. 

If the player does not have the specific cards, they player need to draw the cards from the draw pile until they have the specific cards.
